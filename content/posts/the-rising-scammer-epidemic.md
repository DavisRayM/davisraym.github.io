Scammers have long been a persistent threat to hardworking individuals,
from the classic Nigerian prince scam to government impersonators and
beyond. Over time, we've learned to recognize these obvious schemes but
with advancements in technology(particularly AI) scams have become more
sophisticated and harder to detect at first glance.

Many family members and close friends have reached out to me to verify
job postings, images and sites that raise red flags but are difficult to
assess at a quick glance, which is what inspired me to create this post.
I believe it's still possible with the right approach and some effort,
you can still spot, avoid and report these scams. In this post, I'll
share the steps I take to verify the authenticity of information/posts I
read online and stay safe from malevolent individuals.

## How Technology Advances Have Made Scams More Convincing
We live in a time where technology and readily available resources
empower anyone, including those willing to invest a little effort in
learning or leveraging these tools to run convincing scam campaigns.

For example, AI has enabled scammers to craft highly realistic [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing)
emails, clone voices, and create fraudulent websites. These cases have
gained media attention, such as:  

- [AI clones teen girlâ€™s voice in $1M kidnapping
  scam](https://nypost.com/2023/04/12/ai-clones-teen-girls-voice-in-1m-kidnapping-scam/)
- [French woman duped by AI Brad Pitt faces mockery
  online](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgnz8rw1xgo)

Due to these advancements, struggling economies and the availability of
free online courses that enable people to create websites and learn
techniques used by legitimate organizations, traditional methods of
spotting scams, along with the instincts and habits developed over time,
are becoming less effective. However, by maintaining a skeptical and
detail oriented mindset, you can still identify these scams.

## How To Spot Scams
### 1. Verify The Email Domain / Phone Number Used To Send The Message
Many scam emails and messages come from sources that are not associated
with the legitimate source. For example, consider this sample email
supposedly from Facebook:

![email-example.jpg](../scammer-epidemic-email-example.png)

Instead of assuming the email is from the state source, take the
following steps:

- Look up the official domain used by the organization i.e meta.com
- Confirm that the email matches the verified domain i.e hr@meta.com

### 2. Search For The Organization Online And Verify The Source
One of the most effective ways to identify scams and fake emails is by
verifying the source; **never trust links provided in emails or SMS
blindly**. Instead:

- Manually search for the company or service on Google.
- Compare the URL in the email/SMS with the one you find from search results.
- Check official sources and reputable news sites for articles, policies
  and social media pages. Some sites may have policies that contradict
  what's stated in the email, such as *We never request for your
  password*.

### 3. Locate The Official Website
Fake websites often feature subtle differences in their domain names
since the content and structure can be easily replicated. You need to
take further steps to verify the authenticity:

- Inspect the URL carefully i.e amazon.com vs amaz0n.com
- Use the free [WHOIS](https://www.whois.com) lookup tool to verify
  domain ownership. **Be very suspicious of sites registered recently or
  with no history.**

### 4. View the Website Certificate
Websites utilize a protocol called
[SSL](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-ssl/) and verified
sites usually show a padlock icon while unverified sites show a
warning. However, SSL verification alone is not sufficient, as it's easy
to implement with tools such as [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
Verify the certificate further:

- Verify the site certificate. *Instructions on how to do so can be
  found [here](https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/how-to-view-ssl-certificate-details)*
- Check that the certificate is issued to the correct company and
  contains the correct/expected contact email or number.

### 5. Search for the Job Position / Offer / Issue
Scammers often rely on victims being to scared to verify if the official
company communicates in a different manner. If an email seems too good
to be true or pressures you with urgency, it's likely a scam. Always:

- Check for spelling mistakes; Most organizations tend to take
  spelling/grammar seriously and rarely make mistakes.
- Locate a customer service or contact us email/social media page and
  reach out; No legitimate company will fault you for verifying the authenticity of
  a claim.
- Lookup independent reviews and/or user experiences related to the
  offer or issue

## Common Red Flags
Even without the steps above you can easily identify potential scams by
watching for the following signs:

- **Forces you into urgency**: Scammers usually create a sense of
  urgency in order to force you into action, such as emails/messages
  stating *"Your account will be deleted in 24 hours! Confirm your
  password <here>(Some fake site>"*.
- **Poor grammar, Unusual formatting, Incomplete sites**: Many scams
  contain spelling errors, odd wording, unfriendly formatting or
  incomplete site pages.
- **Unusual payment requests**: Many scams tend to request payment for
  items that do not require any payment. One I've noticed is a Job offer
  requesting that you create an account on a fake bank website and
  deposit X amount of money before you can start the job.
- **Requests too much personal information**: Most legitimate companies
  tend to not request a lot of your personal information; *Of course this
  is on a case by case basis as most sites these days seem to like
  knowing all the things about you...*. Be very careful about sites that
  request your passport, tax-identification number or any other
  information that can be used to impersonate you.

## Conclusion
Technology has made scams harder to spot at a glance, but with a
skeptical mindset and vigilance, you can still protect yourself. Take a
few extra minutes to verify sources and reach out to the official site.

Staying informed and skeptical about information you receive from the
internet is your best defense; **Even trusted sites can be
compromised**. Always think four times before clicking, sharing or
sending any of your private information or money!
